# encryption
This is meant for use by anyone that can read and type. And that can save files.
This DOES NOT save the decrypted message to your computer in an attempt to be as secure as possible.

--HOW TO USE

   Pick a place and name for the file you are creating.
   
   Hit OK
   
   Share the file as you will
   
   -Decrypt
   
   Type the password for the encrypted file
   
   Hit OK
   
   Choose the file to decrypt

--DISCLAIMERS
This is a BETA. USE AS INTENDED. (No warranty is provided and bugs may occur. I am not responsible for anything.)
This isn't meant for encryption of truly sensitive data, just for codes and puzzles. While it is secure, it is not as secure as many public key encryptions. BE CAREFUL. 
I do not take responsibility if your code is cracked and someone reads whatever you encrypted.
